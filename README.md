## 🌐 Playing Online via Ngrok

To play with friends remotely without deploying the app to a cloud server, you can tunnel your local server to the internet using **ngrok**:

### 1. Authenticate Ngrok (First time only)
1. Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com).
2. Retrieve your Authtoken from your ngrok dashboard and run the following command to configure it:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
   ```

### 2. Expose the Local Server
Start ngrok to forward traffic to your local Spring Boot port (`8083`):
```bash
ngrok http 8083
```
Ngrok will generate a secure public URL (e.g., `https://a1b2-c3d4.ngrok-free.app`). Simply share this URL with your friends to let them join the room and play together immediately!
